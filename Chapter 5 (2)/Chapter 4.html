<!--Structuring a webpage ☑️
Using the website reference image below, code this website (focussing on proper structural markup). Your work doesn't need to be exact in attempting to recreate the padding, margins etc., but you do need to recreate the layout of the page exactly, using the structural elements you've been taught. You must include:

Header;
Navigation menu;
The main "Welcome" content;
"Line Up" content, including two square images underneath the text;
Footer;
index.html and style.css files.
These tags might come in useful: <header> <nav> <main> <section> <article> <div> <aside> <footer>

Logo and Heading font: "Tahoma", 700 (Apple users, you may have a tad bit more work to do here)

Body font: "Arial", 400

Header: #17072b

Sidebar: #172d67

Footer: #8c15e9

Text: #000000 and #FFFFFF
